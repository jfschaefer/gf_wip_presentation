## Update (2018-09-04)

The ongoing work has been published as a work-in-progress paper at [CICM 2018](https://www.cicm-conference.org/2018/cicm.php). The title of the paper is *Semantic/Syntactic Analysis for High-Precision Math Linguistics*. You should find it [here](https://kwarc.info/people/mkohlhase/papers/cicm18WiP-gf.pdf).

The slides of the paper presentation at the conference can be found [here](https://www.cicm-conference.org/2018/slides/T28.pdf). They are based on the slides in this repository, but present a slightly later stage of the project. The GF descriptions on the other hand are shortened.


# README

This is a presentation I'm making for a seminar of the KWARC research group.
In it, I'll provide an overview of GF (Grammatical Framework) and what I am currently doing with it in my research (parsing mathematical language).

I don't think anybody outside the research group will be interested in this - but in case I'm wrong, you can find the presentation here :) Please note though that the presentation is not fully self-explanatory.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions etc!
