This is a presentation I'm making for a seminar of the KWARC research group.
In it, I'll provide an overview of GF (Grammatical Framework) and what I am currently doing with it in my research (parsing mathematical language).

I don't think anybody outside the research group will be interested in this - but in case I'm wrong, you can find the presentation here :) Please note though that the presentation is not fully self-explanatory.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions etc!
